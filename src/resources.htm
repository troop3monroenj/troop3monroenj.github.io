<B>Troop 3 strives to keep dues and trip costs to a minimum.  The Troop also offers
fundraising options whereby a Scout can accumulate funds into his own Scout Account to
offset these costs.  However, if the family of a Scout is experiencing a financial hardship,
they are encouraged to speak with either the Troop Committee Chair or the Scoutmaster.</B>
