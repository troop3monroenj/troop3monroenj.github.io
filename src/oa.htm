The Order of the Arrow is Scouting's National Honor Society.
<P>
The purpose of the Order of the Arrow is fourfold:
<UL>
<LI>To recognize those Scout campers who best exemplify the Scout Oath
and Law in their daily lives.
<LI>To develop and maintain camping traditions and spirit.
<LI>To promote Scout camping.
<LI>To crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose
of leadership in cheerful service to others.
</UL>

<P>
The Order of the Arrow (OA) was founded by Dr. E. Urner Goodman and
Carroll A. Edson in 1915 at the Treasure Island Camp of the
Philadelphia Council, Boy Scouts of America. It became an official
program experiment in 1922 and was approved as part of the Scouting
program in 1934.

<P>
In 1948 the OA, recognized as the BSA's national brotherhood of honor
campers, became an official part of the national camping program of
the Boy Scouts of America.
