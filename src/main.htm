<H2><B>About Us</B></H2>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=left>
Our troop is located in Monroe Township, NJ.  We have
been chartered since 1978.  Troop 3 is proud to have as
our chartered organization the Jewish War Veterans Post
609 / Post 395.
<P>
Troop meetings are held weekly, and we try to run a
camping trip, hike, or other activity every month.  We
also participate in community service projects.
<P>
We are proud to uphold and follow the principles of the
Boy Scouts of America.  Since 1910, millions of boys
have joined Scouting because they liked what the Boy
Scouts of America had to offer.
<P>
Troop 3 has produced over 80 Eagle Scouts and the list
continues to grow.
<P>
Come see what we're all about.
